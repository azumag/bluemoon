MASTER CLOCK


MasterClock is the reference clock used by TimingObjects.

It is implemented using performance.now,
but is skewed and rate-adjusted relative to this local clock.

This allows it to be used as a master clock in a distributed system,
where synchronization is generally relative to some other clock than the local clock. 

The master clock may need to be adjusted in time, for instance as a response to 
varying estimation of clock skew or drift. The master clock supports an adjust primitive for this purpose.

What policy is used for adjusting the master clock may depend on the circumstances
and is out of scope for the implementation of the MasterClock.
This policy is implemented by the timing object. This policy may or may not
provide monotonicity.

A change event is emitted every time the masterclock is adjusted.

Vector values define 
- position : absolute value of the clock in seconds
- velocity : how many seconds added per second (1.0 exactly - or very close)
- timestamp : timstamp from local system clock (performance) in seconds. Defines point in time where position and velocity are valid.

If initial vector is not provided, default value is 
{position: now, velocity: 1.0, timestamp: now};
implying that master clock is equal to local clock.
