DERIVATIVE CONVERTER

this Converter implements the derivative of it source timing object.

The velocity of timingsrc becomes the position of the Converter.

This means that the derivative Converter allows sequencing on velocity of a timing object, 
by attatching a sequencer on the derivative Converter.
